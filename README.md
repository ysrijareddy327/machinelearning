he SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction project uses logistic regression to differentiate between underwater rocks and mines using sonar technology. The goal of the project is to improve the reliability of sonar systems to enhance underwater security
Here are some steps involved in the SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction project
->Data preprocessing: The sonar data is preprocessed to make it suitable for training the mode
->Feature selection: Critical acoustic features are identified using feature selection
->Model implementation: The logistic regression model is implemented.
->Performance evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
The project uses sonar data, which is made up of 60 numerical values ranging from 0 to 1. The labels for the data are "M" for mines and "R" for rock
